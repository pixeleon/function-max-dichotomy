Solving the equation:

The main purpose of this application is to find maximum of the function f(x) - g(x),
where f(x) and g(x) functions are defined by user.
For this inside the program the dichotomy (bisection) method is used, that halves the interval
at each step and discards the half that doesn't contain maximum. 
The process is carried out until the required accuracy (0.001, by default) is reached.
Interval is defined as the maximum and the minimum X points for g(x) function.

After defining the functions, you can press SOLVE button in order to find maximum of the
given function f(x) - g(x). If input data is correct, then the program will find X where
y(x) has the biggest value for our function. There results will be shown in the form of text
in the text area below as well as illustrated on the graph on the right. There will be drawn
f(x), g(x) and f(x) - g(x) functions together with the maximum point.

If the specified function is unsolveable (e.g. f(x) and g(x) are coinciding/parallel), then
the program will show the corresponding text, however providing graph drawing without just
the maximum point.

Also, if you want just plot the corresponding graphs without solving the equation, just go 
(Run -> Plot graph). This is what you need.
