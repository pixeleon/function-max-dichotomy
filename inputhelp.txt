Inputting data:
For program to work you have to define functions f(x) and g(x).

f(x) is defined as polynomial of n-th power. For it you have to specify coefficients for each term. 
Polynomial is entered starting from the zero constant and up to as much coefficients as you need.
If a term is absent, you still have to specify it with zero (0) coefficient in order to omit it.
Basically, coefficients can be entered as a list of real values seprated by whitespace 
(e.g. "0.4 11.1 -33.3" means "0 + 11.1x - 33.3x*x").
Do not concat coefficients with any other data (characters, math. functions etc.)! It will ruin the work of the program.
At least zero constant should be defined (or set to zero) in order for program to work.

g(x) is defined as a set of points, pairs of values x / g(x).
For this you have a table 5x2 where you have to determine function points you need.
The amount of points should be not less than two (2) and not greater than five (5). 
However, if you enter more than five pairs for g(x), last odd arguments will be just skipped.
The only data for g(x) is real numbers that represent values for points. Do not spoil it with characters!

If input is invalid and you press SOLVE button, an application will inform you about incorrect data.

Data can be entered either manually at text fields of the application or via reading from already prepared XML-files.
These XML-files should be filled according to the defined schema.
